Review of:
The Deep Sea Diver’s Syndrome
by Serge Russo
Translated by Edward Gauvin
Melville House, 2016

Dreams and reality filter through our minds: What separates the nightmare from the real?  Serge Russo explores these ephemeral boundaries in The Deep Sea Diver’s Syndrome, originally published in 1992 in France and now published by Melville House this year in an English language translation by Edward Gauvin.  This relatively short but intricate novel follows the life of David XXX, a “diver” who submerges completely into the neuro-netherworld of dreams to capture valuable artworks for collectors in the real world. The adventures that David goes through are all consuming, and he lives a fragmented day-to-day existence in his actual flesh. 

The lyrical prose of Russo via Gauvin immediately lures us into this frenetic world of the future, where people vividly waste away for the pleasure of others. Russo offers a science fiction vision where the imagination and the ethereal take on powerful substantive form, as new types of semi-aware creatures that can immeasurably soothe or torment humans in unprecedented ways.
