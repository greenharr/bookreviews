# About bookreviews
This is a repository for managing my drafts of book reviews and other published writings. I'd like to maintain versions of writing through Github for cleaner file organization, rather than a folder full of "draft1.docx", 'draft15.docx", "hopefullyThisIsFinal.docx" etc. as I tend to do....
